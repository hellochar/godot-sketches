# Psyche-Builder: Prototype Specification

## Overview

Psyche-Builder is a city-building game where the city is a metaphor for the human mind. Players construct and manage a "city of the self" - building habits, processing emotions, and developing psychological resilience. The game explores how thoughts, behaviors, and feelings interrelate (as in CBT), emphasizing that mental actions are choices that build habits and skills over time.

The prototype aims to validate whether this mechanic set produces an emotionally resonant experience.

### Core Thesis

Mental health emerges from the interplay of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. By giving players concrete, manageable systems that mirror this interplay, they can:
1. Experience how neglecting one domain affects others
2. See how habits form and free up mental bandwidth
3. Understand negative spirals and how to break them
4. Feel the satisfaction of building a resilient, flourishing mind

### Narrative Frame: Hero's Journey (Man vs Self)

Each run follows a personal growth arc:
1. **Ordinary World**: Player builds up their mind-city from a basic state
2. **Inciting Incident**: An event introduces new emotions/challenges (not damage - opportunities with tradeoffs)
3. **Rising Action**: Player grapples with the new situation, systems interact in interesting ways
4. **Climax**: Personal growth and insight emerge from successful integration
5. **Resolution**: Multiple endings based on final state (no hard failure)

---

## Time Structure: Day/Night Rhythm

The game runs in discrete **days**, each with two phases:

### Daytime Phase (~30-60 seconds real-time)
- Simulation runs: workers move resources, buildings process, events occur
- Player can adjust speed (1x, 2x, 3x)
- Events may pause for decisions
- Resources flow, emotions arise and decay

### Evening Phase (paused)
- Planning and building
- Review city state, make decisions
- Assign new workers
- Events resolve

### Narrative flavor per time-of-day:
- **Morning**: Energy replenishes naturally
- **Afternoon**: Peak productivity, most processing happens
- **Evening**: Emotions surface, reflection time
- **Night**: Transition, preparation for next day

---

## Economy & Resources

### Energy (Special Currency)

Energy is a number without physical location (like money in city builders).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Starting amount | 10 (tunable) |
| Max capacity | 20 (tunable) |
| Natural regen | +3 per day (tunable) |
| Uses | Building construction, starting new worker assignments, some building operations |

Energy represents your capacity to take deliberate action. It's spent to make changes but regenerates with rest.

### Attention (Worker Budget)

Attention is your capacity for ongoing mental processes.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Base pool | 10 (tunable) |
| Worker cost | Starts at 1.0 per assignment |
| Habituation | Cost decreases with repetition: 1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25 → 0.1 → 0 |

See Workers section for details.

### Physical Resources (Emotions, Thoughts, Sensations)

Resources are physical items that exist in the game world. They:
- Spawn at specific locations
- Must be transported via roads by workers
- Are stored in buildings with capacity limits
- Are consumed/transformed by processing buildings
- Have UI totals tracked (sum of all instances city-wide)

#### Resource Categories

Resources are tagged with categories for building requirements and effects:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `emotion.positive` | Pleasant emotional states | Joy, Love, Excitement, Pride |
| `emotion.negative` | Unpleasant emotional states | Grief, Anger, Fear, Shame |
| `emotion.neutral` | Neutral emotional tones | Calm, Curiosity, Surprise |
| `thought.positive` | Helpful thought patterns | Hope, Confidence, Gratitude |
| `thought.negative` | Unhelpful thought patterns | Worry, Doubt, Rumination |
| `sensation` | Physical/bodily experiences | Tension, Fatigue, Restlessness |
| `derived` | Processed/refined resources | Wisdom, Insight, Resilience |
| `transient` | Decays quickly if not used | Most raw emotions |
| `persistent` | Decays slowly or not at all | Derived resources, some thoughts |

#### Resource List (Target: 25-30)

**Positive Emotions:**
- Joy - transient, boosts nearby building efficiency
- Love - persistent, enables relationship-related buildings
- Excitement - transient, speeds up processing but increases energy cost
- Pride - semi-persistent, generated by achievements
- Contentment - persistent, reduces negative emotion generation
- Hope - semi-persistent, counters despair

**Negative Emotions:**
- Grief - persistent until processed, slows nearby buildings
- Anger - transient but intense, can be channeled or causes damage
- Fear - transient, triggers avoidance behaviors
- Shame - persistent, reduces building efficiency globally
- Anxiety - generates more of itself if not addressed
- Loneliness - persistent, debuffs relationship district
- Despair - heavy, persistent, counters hope

**Neutral/Complex Emotions:**
- Calm - persistent, required for many positive processes
- Curiosity - transient, boosts learning/insight generation
- Surprise - very transient, can become positive or negative
- Nostalgia - bittersweet, can generate both joy and grief
- Boredom - accumulates when nothing is happening

**Thoughts:**
- Worry - generates anxiety if not processed
- Doubt - reduces efficiency of nearby buildings  
- Rumination - multiplies if stored, consumes attention
- Confidence - boosts building success rates
- Gratitude - converts easily to joy
- Hope-thought - more cognitive than hope-emotion

**Sensations:**
- Tension - physical stress, converts to anxiety if ignored
- Fatigue - reduces energy regeneration
- Restlessness - requires physical outlet
- Comfort - reduces tension, enables rest

**Derived Resources:**
- Wisdom - refined from processed grief, enables advanced buildings
- Insight - generated by reflection, unlocks new buildings
- Resilience - accumulated from overcoming challenges
- Meaning - rare, generated by integration experiences

#### Resource Properties (defined in .tres files)

## Workers (Attention Motes)

Workers are abstract representations of attention - visualized as glowing motes of light that move through the city.

### Core Mechanic

Each worker has exactly one job:
- Carry resource from Point A to Point B
- Operate a building (some buildings need a worker to function)
- Patrol/maintain an area

### Assignment Cost & Habituation

Starting a new worker assignment costs Attention from your pool.

| Repetition Level | Attention Cost | Time to Reach |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| New | 1.0 | - |
| Familiar | 0.5 | 5 completions |
| Practiced | 0.25 | 15 completions |
| Habitual | 0.1 | 30 completions |
| Automatic | 0 | 50 completions |

**Design rationale**: This models how habits form. Early on you're attention-constrained. Over time, repeated behaviors become automatic, freeing attention for new challenges.

### Worker Behaviors

- Workers pathfind along roads/paths
- If no path exists, they cannot complete the job
- Workers waiting (no resource to carry, building idle) don't actively cost attention but the assignment still reserves the slot
- Workers can be reassigned (costs attention again, resets habituation for new job)

### Developer Knobs
- `base_attention_pool`: Starting attention (default: 10)
- `habituation_thresholds`: Array of completion counts for each level
- `habituation_costs`: Array of attention costs at each level
- `attention_growth_enabled`: Whether attention can grow (default: false for prototype)

---

## Buildings

Buildings are the core interactive elements. Rather than strict types, buildings have **behaviors** that combine:

### Building Behaviors

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `generator` | Produces resources over time or on trigger |
| `processor` | Transforms input resources into output resources |
| `storage` | Holds resources with capacity limit |
| `consumer` | Uses resources to produce global effects |
| `habit` | Runs automatically when conditions met |
| `coping` | Activates reactively under certain conditions |
| `infrastructure` | Enables connections (roads, bridges) |
| `global_effect` | Provides passive city-wide bonuses |

A single building can have multiple behaviors (e.g., a Habit that is also a Generator).

### Building List (Target: ~50)

Buildings are organized by primary function, though many have multiple behaviors.

#### Generation Buildings
1. **Memory Well** - Generates Nostalgia periodically; can produce Grief or Joy depending on context
2. **Energy Spring** - Natural energy regeneration boost
3. **Emotion Fountain** - Random positive emotion generation
4. **Worry Factory** - Generates Worry (negative, but sometimes placed by events)
5. **Hope Beacon** - Generates Hope slowly
6. **Curiosity Garden** - Generates Curiosity when new buildings are built nearby
7. **Comfort Hearth** - Generates Comfort and Calm
8. **Excitement Generator** - Produces Excitement, consumes Energy faster
9. **Pride Monument** - Generates Pride when milestones are reached
10. **Love Shrine** - Generates Love, requires two connected districts

#### Processing Buildings
11. **Mourning Chapel** - Grief → Wisdom
12. **Anger Forge** - Anger → Determination (derived positive)
13. **Fear Processing Plant** - Fear → Caution (useful) + Courage (small amount)
14. **Shame Sanctuary** - Shame → Self-Compassion → Resilience
15. **Anxiety Diffuser** - Anxiety → Calm (slow but steady)
16. **Reflection Pool** - Multiple negative thoughts → Insight
17. **Gratitude Converter** - Small positives → Gratitude → Joy
18. **Integration Temple** - Mixed emotions → Meaning (expensive, late-game)
19. **Tension Release** - Tension → Calm + small Energy boost
20. **Rumination Recycler** - Rumination → Insight (slow) or more Rumination (if overwhelmed)

#### Storage Buildings
21. **Emotional Reservoir** - General emotion storage
22. **Memory Archive** - Long-term storage for any resource, slow decay
23. **Thought Library** - Thought-type storage
24. **Quick Cache** - Small capacity, no decay, fast access
25. **Deep Storage** - Large capacity, slow in/out

#### Habit Buildings
26. **Morning Routine** - Daily: Generates Energy, Calm, slight structure
27. **Exercise Yard** - Consumes Energy → Produces Vitality, reduces Tension
28. **Meditation Garden** - Consumes Attention → Produces Calm, Insight over time
29. **Journaling Corner** - Processes recent emotions into Insight
30. **Social Connection Hub** - Requires Love input, generates Joy, prevents Loneliness
31. **Creative Studio** - Consumes Curiosity + Energy → Joy + occasional Insight
32. **Sleep Chamber** - Night phase: Restores Energy, processes some emotions passively
33. **Gratitude Practice** - Daily small conversion to Gratitude
34. **Boundary Wall** - Habit that prevents certain negative resources from entering an area

#### Coping Mechanism Buildings
35. **Emergency Calm Center** - Activates when Anxiety spikes, rapid Anxiety → Calm
36. **Anger Vent** - Activates when Anger high, releases Anger (removes it, small energy cost)
37. **Comfort Den** - Activates during distress, generates Comfort but drains Energy
38. **Distraction Station** - Temporarily halts negative emotion processing (avoidance - double-edged)
39. **Support Hotline** - Activates in crisis, generates Hope + outside resources
40. **Grounding Chamber** - Activates during dissociation/overwhelm, restores baseline function

#### Infrastructure
41. **Road** - Basic connection
42. **Bridge** - Connects across gaps (future: emotions that create "gaps")
43. **Highway** - Faster transport
44. **Attention Amplifier** - Workers in range are more efficient

#### Global Effect Buildings (Build-Defining)
45. **Optimism Lens** - All positive emotions generate 20% more
46. **Stoic Foundation** - Negative emotions decay 25% faster but positive emotions also dampened
47. **Creative Core** - Insight generation doubled, but requires more Curiosity
48. **Compassion Center** - Shame processing twice as effective everywhere
49. **Resilience Monument** - After surviving crisis events, permanent small buff
50. **Acceptance Shrine** - Negative emotions cause less efficiency penalty

### Unlocking New Buildings

Buildings are unlocked through:
1. **Starting palette**: ~8-10 buildings available at start
2. **Resource thresholds**: Accumulate X total Insight to unlock
3. **Event rewards**: Completing event challenges grants building unlocks
4. **Discovery**: Random offerings during Evening phase (choose 1 of 3)
5. **Milestone unlocks**: Reach certain Wellbeing levels

The limited-palette-per-run comes from:
- Different starting archetypes have different starting buildings
- Random discovery means different buildings become available each run
- Events can grant unique buildings

---

## Adjacency System

Since we're not using formal districts, adjacency effects create emergent spatial organization.

### Adjacency Rules

Buildings within 2 tiles of each other can have:

**Synergies** (positive effects):
- Mourning Chapel + Memory Well: +20% processing speed
- Meditation Garden + Reflection Pool: +15% Insight generation
- Exercise Yard + Sleep Chamber: +25% Energy restoration

**Conflicts** (negative effects):
- Rumination Pit + Sleep Chamber: -30% sleep effectiveness
- Worry Factory + Hope Beacon: Both produce 20% less
- Anger Forge + Calm areas: Anger processing creates spillover Tension

**Neutral proximity effects**:
- Storage buildings near processors reduce transport time
- Multiple generators of same type have diminishing returns

### Implementation

Each building can define:
```gdscript
"adjacency_effects": {
    "building_id": {
        "efficiency": 1.2,      # multiplier
        "output_bonus": 0.5,    # flat bonus
        "special": "some_func"  # custom logic
    }
}
```

---

## City Metrics

### Wellbeing (Primary Score)

Wellbeing is the main success metric - a composite score displayed prominently.

**Calculation:**
```
Wellbeing = (
    positive_emotion_total * 2
    + derived_resource_total * 3  
    - negative_emotion_total * 1.5
    - unprocessed_persistent_negatives * 2
    + habit_buildings_running * 1
    + adjacency_synergies * 0.5
) / normalizing_factor
```

Scale: 0-100, starting around 30-40.

**Wellbeing effects:**
- Visual: City brightness, color saturation, ambient sounds
- Narrative: Determines ending
- Mechanical: No direct gameplay effects (for prototype)

### Other Tracked Metrics (UI display)

- **Total of each resource** (city-wide sum)
- **Processing throughput** (resources processed per day)
- **Attention used / available**
- **Energy current / max**
- **Buildings active / total**
- **Habituation progress** (how many workers are at each level)

---

## Events & Inciting Incidents

### Event System

Events are drawn from pools based on game phase:

| Phase | Timing | Event Types |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Early | Days 1-5 | Tutorial, gentle positive/negative |
| Mid | Days 6-15 | Mixed, challenging, build-defining |
| Late | Days 16+ | Climactic, integration opportunities |

### Event Structure

```gdscript
{
    "id": "rejection_event",
    "name": "The Rejection",
    "phase": "mid",
    "type": "inciting_incident",
    
    "description": "Something you cared about deeply has ended. A relationship, a job, a dream.",
    
    # What the event spawns

    "completion_reward": {
        "unlock_building": "resilience_monument",
        "spawn": {"resource": "wisdom", "amount": 5}
    }
}
```

### Inciting Incident Pool (prototype)

These are the major events that define a run's challenge:

1. **The Rejection** - Spawns Grief, Shame, Anger. Challenge: process shame without spiraling.

2. **The Loss** - Spawns heavy Grief, Loneliness, Nostalgia. Challenge: move through grief to wisdom.

3. **The Failure** - Spawns Shame, Doubt, Fear. Challenge: rebuild confidence.

4. **The Overwhelm** - Spawns Anxiety, Tension, Fatigue. Challenge: establish calm without avoidance.

5. **The Betrayal** - Spawns Anger, Grief, Doubt. Challenge: process anger constructively.

6. **The Change** (positive inciting incident) - Spawns Excitement, Fear, Hope. Challenge: manage transition without burning out.

### Minor Events Pool

Smaller events that add variety:

- **Good Day**: Random positive emotion burst
- **Bad Sleep**: Reduced energy regeneration for a day
- **Unexpected Joy**: Joy spawns somewhere
- **Intrusive Thought**: Worry or Rumination spawns
- **Memory Surfaces**: Nostalgia + random emotion
- **Social Moment**: Love or Loneliness depending on city state
- **Creative Spark**: Curiosity burst
- **Body Check-In**: Tension or Comfort awareness

---

archetype_modifiers: {productivity: 1.1, rest: 0.9, anxiety_rate: 0.5}
```

---

## Win/End Conditions

### No Hard Lose State

The game doesn't have a "game over." Instead:

- If Wellbeing drops very low, things get harder (visual dimness, slower processing)
- The run continues until the time limit
- Even struggling runs reach an ending with narrative closure

### Time Limit

Runs last a set number of days (e.g., 20 days for prototype). This can be tuned.

### Multiple Endings

Based on final Wellbeing score and specific achievements:

**Flourishing Ending** (Wellbeing 80+):
> "Through careful attention and compassionate action, the mind has found balance. Challenges became teachers. Pain became wisdom. This is what growth looks like."

**Growing Ending** (Wellbeing 50-79):
> "The mind weathered the storm. Some scars remain, but also new strengths. The journey continues."

**Surviving Ending** (Wellbeing 20-49):
> "It was hard. Really hard. But you made it through. Rest now. Tomorrow is another chance."

**Struggling Ending** (Wellbeing <20):
> "Sometimes the weight is too much for one attempt. That's okay. Minds can always try again, with new knowledge, new approaches. This isn't failure - it's learning."

### Specific Achievements (affect ending flavor)

- Processed all inciting incident resources
- Built an Integration Temple
- Reached 50+ Wisdom
- Maintained 0 Rumination for 5+ days
- All habit buildings reached Automatic habituation
- Never used Distraction Station (faced everything directly)

---

## Visual Style

### Aesthetic: Mindspace

A blend of:
- **Neural imagery**: Glowing pathways like synapses, buildings with organic curves
- **City elements**: Recognizable structures but ethereal/abstract
- **Inside Out inspiration**: Personality islands, memory orbs, emotion characters

### Color Language

- **Positive emotions**: Warm golds, soft pinks, gentle greens
- **Negative emotions**: Cool blues, purples, grays (not harsh reds for anger - more like deep orange)
- **Derived resources**: Iridescent, crystalline
- **Infrastructure**: Soft white/silver glow
- **Attention motes**: White-gold particles

### Visual Feedback

- Wellbeing affects overall saturation and lighting
- Active buildings pulse gently
- Resources glow with their color
- Workers leave faint trails as they move
- Processing creates satisfying particle effects
- Negative states create subtle visual "noise" or dimming

### UI Elements

- Resource totals in a clean bar/panel
- Minimap showing city overview
- Building info on hover/select
- Day/night indicator
- Wellbeing meter (prominent)
- Event notifications (toast-style)

---

## Roguelike Variation

For replayability across runs:

### Sources of Variation

1. **Inciting incident drawn randomly** - Different emotional challenges
2. **Starting palette variation** - Different archetypes have different starting buildings
3. **Discovery RNG** - Different buildings offered during play
4. **Event sequence** - Minor events drawn randomly

### Future Variation (post-prototype)

- Multiple archetypes with distinct starting conditions
- Resource behavior modifiers ("this mind's anger burns hot")
- Meta-progression unlocks across runs
- Challenge modifiers

### Key Singletons (Autoload)

**GameState** - Central state:
- Current day, phase (day/night)
- Energy, attention pools
- All active buildings, workers, resources
- Wellbeing score
- Event history

**EventBus** - Decoupled communication:
- `resource_spawned(resource, location)`
- `resource_processed(input, output, building)`
- `building_placed(building)`
- `day_started()`, `night_started()`
- `worker_assigned(worker, job)`
- `wellbeing_changed(old, new)`

**Config** - Developer knobs:
- All tunable values in one place
- Easy to adjust for testing

---

7. One complete event
8. Wellbeing display
9. One ending

### Should Have
1. Full resource set (20+)
2. Full building set (30+)
3. Adjacency effects
4. Habituation system
5. Multiple events
6. Multiple endings
7. Building discovery/unlocking

### Nice to Have
1. All 50 buildings
2. Multiple archetypes
3. Full visual polish
4. Sound design
5. Tutorial
6. Meta-progression

---

## Open Questions for Playtesting

1. Is the day length right? (Too short = frantic, too long = boring)
2. Does habituation feel rewarding or ignorable?
3. Are negative emotions threatening enough without being punishing?
4. Do players naturally discover synergies?
5. Is Wellbeing a satisfying score to optimize?
6. Do different inciting incidents feel meaningfully different?
7. Is the building count right? (Too few = solved quickly, too many = overwhelming)
8. Does the metaphor land? Do players make the connection to real psychology?
