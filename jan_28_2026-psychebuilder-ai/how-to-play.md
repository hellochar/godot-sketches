## Core Resources

### Positive (increase Wellbeing)
- **Joy** - Pure happiness, boosts worker speed
- **Calm** - Serenity, creates soothing auras that suppress negativity
- **Wisdom** - Accumulated knowledge, improves processing efficiency
- **Insight** - Deep understanding, valuable end-game resource

### Negative (decrease Wellbeing)
- **Grief** - Sadness from loss, slows nearby buildings
- **Anxiety** - Nervousness, spreads to neighbors when it overflows
- **Worry** - Compounding thoughts, multiplies over time
- **Doubt** - Uncertainty, penalizes building efficiency
- **Tension** - Stress from overwork, slows processing

### Neutral
- **Nostalgia** - Bittersweet memories, can become Joy OR Grief depending on context

---

## Building Types

### Generators (produce resources automatically)
- **Memory Well** - Generates Nostalgia (can become Joy or Grief)
- **Comfort Hearth** - Generates Calm
- **Old Wound** - Generates Grief (you start with some)
- **Worry Loop** - Generates Anxiety
- **Rumination Spiral** - Generates Worry
- **Inner Critic** - Generates Doubt

### Processors (transform resources, some need workers)
- **Mourning Chapel** - Grief → Wisdom (needs worker)
- **Anxiety Diffuser** - Anxiety → Calm (automatic)
- **Memory Processor** - Nostalgia → Joy (if Calm nearby) or Grief (if Tension nearby)
- **Reflection Pool** - Worry + Doubt → Insight (needs worker)
- **Grounding Station** - Worry + Calm → Insight (automatic)

### Storage
- **Emotional Reservoir** - Holds 20 of any resource

### Habits (trigger once per day)
- **Morning Routine** - Generates Calm + Energy each morning
- **Exercise Yard** - Consumes Energy, reduces Tension, generates Calm

### Coping (trigger reactively)
- **Emergency Calm Center** - Activates when Anxiety > 10, converts Anxiety → Calm

### Infrastructure
- **Road** - Workers travel along roads between buildings

## Basic Walkthrough

### Day 1-3: Setup
1. You start with some **Old Wounds** generating Grief
2. Build a **Mourning Chapel** near the Wounds
3. Build **Roads** connecting them
4. Click "Add Worker" to spawn a worker
5. Click the Wound → click the Chapel to assign transport
6. The worker carries Grief to the Chapel, which converts it to Wisdom

### Day 4-7: Expand
1. Build a **Memory Well** to generate Nostalgia
2. Build a **Comfort Hearth** next to it for Calm aura
3. Build a **Memory Processor** - with Calm nearby, Nostalgia becomes Joy
4. Build a **Morning Routine** for daily Calm + Energy
5. Assign workers to transport Nostalgia to the Processor

### Day 8-12: Handle Negatives
1. If Anxiety is building up, place an **Anxiety Diffuser**
2. Build a **Grounding Station** to convert Worry + Calm into Insight
3. Place buildings with Calm near your negative generators to suppress them
4. Watch for **Worry compounding** - it multiplies if left unchecked (>3)

### Day 13-17: Optimize
1. Build **Habit** buildings in clusters for adjacency bonus
2. Watch for **Building Attunement** - same-type buildings nearby bond for efficiency
3. Aim for **Flow State** by processing pure resources in multiple buildings
4. Let workers develop **Focus Imprints** on specific building types

### Day 18-20: Final Push
1. Check your Wellbeing tier in the HUD
2. Convert remaining negative resources to Wisdom/Insight
3. Let buildings reach **Mastery** through repeated processing
4. Form **Core Beliefs** from buildings that processed 100+ resources

## Advanced Mechanics to Discover

### Environmental Systems
- **Emotional Weather** changes each day (Clear Skies, Overcast, Fog, Storm, Stillness)
- **Day/Night cycle** - workers rest at night, dream recombination can occur
- **Flow State** - triggered when multiple buildings process pure resources simultaneously

### Building Behaviors
- **Attunement** [A] - Same-type buildings nearby share efficiency
- **Mastery** [M] - Buildings specialize in resource types they process often
- **Velocity** [V] - Fast throughput builds processing momentum
- **Legacy** [L] - Workers leave permanent imprints on buildings
- **Sync Chains** [S] - Buildings processing same resources synchronize

### Resource Quality
- **Purity** - Resources degrade when mixed, pure resources (>80%) give bonuses
- Shown as `*` (pure) or `~` (diluted) in tooltips

### Auras (hover over buildings to see)
- Blue circle = Calm aura (suppresses negativity)
- Red circle = Tension aura (spreads stress)
- Purple circle = Wisdom aura (boosts efficiency)

## Tips
- **Place Calm generators** near negative generators to suppress them
- **Cluster Habit buildings** for adjacency bonuses
- **Don't ignore Worry** - it compounds exponentially
- **Roads are cheap** - build a good road network early
- **Workers get fatigued** - they recover at night
- **Watch the weather** - it affects all processing speeds
- **Hover buildings** to see their status, storage, and aura ranges
