- **Highway** - Faster transport

### Global Effect (city-wide bonuses)
- **Optimism Lens** - All positive emotions +20%
- **Stoic Foundation** - Negative emotions decay faster
- **Compassion Center** - Shame processing 2x effective
- **Acceptance Shrine** - Negative emotions cause less penalty

---

## Adjacency System

Buildings within 2 tiles affect each other:

### Synergies (green lines when selected)
- Mourning Chapel + Memory Well: +20% processing speed
- Meditation Garden + Reflection Pool: +15% Insight generation
- Exercise Yard + Sleep Chamber: +25% rest quality
- Comfort Hearth + Anxiety Diffuser: +15% efficiency

### Conflicts (red lines when selected)
- Rumination Spiral + Sleep Chamber: -30% sleep effectiveness
- Worry Loop + Hope Beacon: Both produce 20% less
- Anger Forge + Comfort buildings: Creates Tension spillover
- Inner Critic + Grounding Station: -15% efficiency

### Diminishing Returns
Multiple generators of the same type have reduced output. Spread them out!

---

## Events

### Inciting Incidents (major events around Day 5)
Events challenge you with waves of emotions to process:
- **The Rejection** - Grief, Shame, Anger
- **The Loss** - Heavy Grief, Loneliness, Nostalgia
- **The Failure** - Shame, Doubt, Fear
- **The Overwhelm** - Anxiety, Tension, Fatigue
- **The Betrayal** - Anger, Grief, Doubt
- **The Change** - Excitement, Fear, Hope (positive)

Each event offers choices and rewards for completion.

### Minor Events (random each day)
- **Good Day** - Random positive emotions
- **Intrusive Thought** - Worry spawns
- **Memory Surfaces** - Nostalgia + random emotion
- **Creative Spark** - Curiosity burst

---

## Discovery System

At the end of some days, you'll be offered 3 new buildings to discover. Pick one to add to your building palette. This makes each playthrough unique!

---

## Basic Walkthrough

### Day 1-3: Setup (Tutorial hints will guide you)
1. You start with a **Memory Well**, **Emotional Reservoir**, **Morning Routine**, and **Exercise Yard**
2. Build **Roads** connecting your buildings
3. Click "Add Worker" to spawn a worker
4. Assign workers to transport resources between buildings

### Day 4-7: Expand
1. Build a **Comfort Hearth** near processors for Calm aura
2. Build an **Anxiety Diffuser** if negativity accumulates
3. Use adjacency synergies - place processors near related generators

### Day 8-12: Handle Inciting Incident
1. An inciting incident will trigger - prepare processors for the wave
2. Make your choice in the event popup
3. Work toward the completion condition for rewards
4. Build coping buildings if overwhelmed

### Day 13-17: Optimize
1. Check for building discoveries each night
2. Place buildings strategically for adjacency bonuses
3. Let workers develop habits (attention cost decreases)
4. Watch for synergies and avoid conflicts

### Day 18-20: Final Push
1. Process remaining negative resources
2. Check your Wellbeing tier in the HUD
3. Global effect buildings can tip the balance

## Advanced Mechanics

### Building Behaviors
- **Attunement** - Same-type buildings nearby share efficiency
- **Mastery** - Buildings specialize in resource types they process often
- **Velocity** - Fast throughput builds processing momentum

### Worker Mechanics
- **Habituation** - Repeated jobs cost less attention (1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25 → 0.1 → 0)
- **Fatigue** - Workers tire during the day, recover at night
- **Focus Imprints** - Workers specialize in specific building types

### Auras (hover over buildings to see)
- Blue circle = Calm aura (suppresses negativity)
- Red circle = Tension aura (spreads stress)
- Purple circle = Wisdom aura (boosts efficiency)

---

## Tips
- **Place Calm generators** near negative generators to suppress them
- **Use adjacency synergies** - check the green/red lines when selecting buildings
- **Don't ignore Worry** - it compounds exponentially when > 3
- **Roads are cheap** - build a good road network early
- **Workers get habituated** - keep them on consistent routes
- **Respond to events** - choices matter for both immediate and long-term effects
- **Check discoveries** - new buildings unlock unique strategies
- **Hover buildings** to see their status, storage, and adjacency effects
