## Part 1: Kind Games Framework

### Definition
**Kind Games** are multiplayer games intentionally designed to emphasize prosocial behavior where players help one another. They have:
- Systems that encourage players to help one another and their community
- Authentic attachments that alleviate loneliness
- Groups that interact peacefully
- Toxic behavior carefully monitored and mediated
- Social systems that foster belonging

### Kind Values Framework

#### MUST HAVES (Required for prosocial behavior)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Players feel they can share and contribute without fear. They can opt into additional intimacy if they desire. |
| **Interdependence** | Players must rely on one another to achieve more than an individual can accomplish alone. Systems provide underlying incentives for positive cooperation and coordination. |

#### ACCELERATORS (More = more prosocial behavior)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Belonging** | Players feel strong sense of membership in a community. A fundamental social need providing intrinsic motivation for further kind behavior. |
| **Shared Identity** | Group identity that unifies players beyond individual differences. |
| **Trust** | Players can predict how others will behave and act accordingly. |

#### MAINTENANCE (Long-term health)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Toxicity Reduction** | Active systems to identify and address harmful behavior. |
| **Community Support** | Systems that prevent degenerate states and support positive norms. |

### Kind Games Design Patterns

1. **Win-Win Situations**: Make it easy and rewarding to help others
2. **Closed Communication**: Limited communication (e.g., single chirp) to limit toxicity
3. **No Player Collisions**: Prevent griefing through physics
4. **Instanced Powerups**: Per-player resources so "selfish" grabs appear altruistic (pointing out locations)
5. **Shared Tending**: Co-created bases requiring collaborative maintenance (Valheim pattern)

### Kind Games Anti-Patterns (Toxicity Generators)

- Making it expensive to help others
- Making it easy to be selfish
- Zero-sum competition for limited resources
- Power accumulation as only path to safety (DayZ pattern)
- Individualist power fantasies without social accountability
- High stakes + hazardous worlds + limited resources = seeing strangers as enemies

## Part 2: Cozy Games Framework

### Core Definition
Coziness evokes the fantasy of **Safety, Abundance, and Softness**.

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Risk and danger (physical, emotional, social) are minimized |
| **Abundance** | Lower-level needs are met; nothing is lacking or pressing |
| **Softness** | Stimuli are gentle and comforting, reducing stress |

These three pillars reinforce each other and encourage:
- Intimacy of space and emotion
- Slower pace
- Authenticity, sincerity, and humanity
- Space for reflection and thought

### Cozy Design Elements

#### Cozy Locations
- "Third spaces" separate from work/home (bars, cafes, libraries, cabins, gardens)
- Transition spaces without danger or obligation
- Places supporting low-intensity companionship
- Domestic places and hobby/craft spaces
- Private spaces allowing creative expression

#### Cozy Content Characteristics
- Centered on leisure, practicality, ritual, history, familiarity
- Allows privacy and creative expression
- Companionship or solitude as preferred (opt-in)
- Intrinsic satisfaction from activities

#### Cozy Aesthetics
- Soft and warm colors
- Slow-paced gameplay
- Nature-inspired environments
- Calming, diegetic audio design

### Elements That NEGATE Coziness

| Anti-Cozy Element | Why It Breaks Coziness |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Extrinsic rewards | Shifts focus from intrinsic enjoyment |
| Dangers or threats | Violates safety |
| Responsibility/pressure | Creates stress, removes abundance feeling |
| Distractions | Breaks immersion and peace |
| Intense stimulus | Violates softness |
| Vast distances | Reduces intimacy |
| Non-consensual social situations | Violates safety and control |
| Confinement | Removes sense of freedom |
| Deception | Violates trust and authenticity |
| Opulence | Can feel impersonal, not homey |
| Pop-up notifications | Use intense stimuli, create responsibility, are non-consensual |

### Cozy Multiplayer Design
Instead of: Limited resources + High stakes + Hazardous worlds = Competitive/hostile behavior

Use: **Abundance + Safety + Reprieve** = Cooperative and trustful interactions

## Part 3: Friendship Formation Patterns

### The Friendship Formula
Four key factors that, when present, cause friendships to form:

#### 1. PROXIMITY
**Goal**: Put players in serendipitous situations where they regularly encounter other players.

Design Patterns:
- Shared spaces players naturally pass through
- Recognition systems across multiple play sessions
- Repeated encounters with same players
- Small server populations (human-scale)

#### 2. SIMILARITY
**Goal**: Create shared identities, values, contexts, and goals.

Design Patterns:
- Guild/clan systems
- Shared aesthetics and customization
- Common goals and quests
- Shared game knowledge and culture
- Similar skill levels/matchmaking

#### 3. RECIPROCITY
**Goal**: Enable exchanges that are bi-directional with benefits to both parties.

Design Patterns:
- Gift-giving systems
- Complementary abilities requiring cooperation
- Trade systems
- Helping mechanics with visible benefit to helper
- Thank you/appreciation systems

#### 4. DISCLOSURE
**Goal**: Grow trust through disclosing vulnerability and testing boundaries.

Design Patterns:
- Safe ways to share personal expression
- Opt-in intimacy levels
- Gradual trust-building mechanics
- Private communication channels
- Vulnerable cooperation moments

### Friendship Formation Principles

- **Long-term process**: Each reciprocation loop may take seconds, but thousands of linked loops build robust friendship
- **Low-cost early loops**: Low rejection costs for early relations
- **Higher-cost later loops**: For deeper term relationships
- **Predictability**: Good social norms rely on predictable behavior; random/unreliable behavior prevents norm formation

## Part 4: Prosocial Economics

### Core Philosophy
Use economics to support prosocial design goals:
- Reducing loneliness
- Decreasing toxicity
- Boosting positive connections

### Abundance vs. Scarcity

| Scarcity Economy | Abundance Economy |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Zero-sum resources | Positive-sum resources |
| Players hoard for themselves | Players give freely |
| Strangers are competitors | Strangers are potential friends |
| Fight or Flight motivation | Cooperation motivation |

### Gift Economy Patterns

**Gifting Loops**:
- Give something as overture
- Other player responds
- Builds social capital

**Warning**: Too many gifts = spam = low-value transactional exchange. Quality over quantity.

### Balancing Abundance

Virtual worlds can make any resource positive-sum, but true abundance lacks interesting constraints.

Solutions:
- **Per-player caps**: Limit harvestable resources per player
- **Per-group caps**: Limit total resources per group
- **Transaction costs**: Large taxes prevent global pooling, encourage local use

### Perceived Intent Principle
Recipients care about **perceived intent**, not actual intent. Design for the perception of selflessness to increase social capital formation, even if using extrinsic motivators behind the scenes.

### Dark Patterns to Avoid

| Dark Pattern | Harm |
|--------------|------|
| Pay to Skip | Sells elements to skip core challenges |
| Grinding | Forces repetitive mechanics |
| Playing by Appointment | Forces play during specific times |
| Hidden Costs | Delays true cost until psychological/financial investment |
| Predatory Monetization | Exploits invested players |
| Proxy Metric Optimization | Optimizes measurable proxies while damaging actual social value |

## Part 5: Human-Scale Social Design

### Dunbar's Number for Games

| Layer | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Intimate friends | 5 | Closest relationships |
| Best friends | 15 | Strong bonds |
| Good friends | 50 | Regular meaningful contact |
| Total friendships | 150 | Maximum social capacity |

**Key Insight**: Online platforms show the same relationship distribution. Technology does not break Dunbar's Number.

### Human-Scale Design Principles

1. **Focus on relationship bonds** between individuals, not massive populations
2. **Limit server/group sizes** to foster recognition and repeated interaction
3. **Support Dunbar layers** with appropriate social tools for each intimacy level
4. **Embrace "small"**: Many early MUDs with dozens-to-thousands still thrive; Minecraft servers succeed despite small size

### Avoiding "Massively" Problems

MMO challenges from the term "Massively":
- Technical: server scaling
- Design: scaling economics, politics, level design, pacing, persistence, progression

Alternative: Design for smaller, meaningful communities within larger ecosystems.
